# Guess the Build Cheat
This is a tool originally created by [**@croutonix**](https://github.com/Croutonix) and modified and re-styled being more Hypixel orientated.

My version of this tool is publically avaliable at https://luke.mx/gtb/ and can be used for Hypixel, The Hive and Mineplex.

## Contribute
You can contribute to this project mostly by adding words to the `wordlist-xxxx.txt` files if you notice any are missing. Don't forget to separate each with a comma except after the last word. 

## CactiveClient GTB Module

The [CactiveClient](https://discord.gg/NeqVuSy) created by [**@tascord**](https://github.com/tascord) and [**@caykey**](https://github.com/caykey) also has a Guess the Build modification made for Hypixel.

A video of this being showcased is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QubbigvPGAw) on my YouTube channel with exclusive features such as AutoGuess.

We don't plan to make this public in the future, however you can apply to be a beta tester in our Discord [here](https://discord.gg/NeqVuSy).
